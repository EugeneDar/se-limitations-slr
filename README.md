# Symbolic Execution Limitations - Systematic Literature Review

This repo contains supplementary artifacts produced in the process of work on the systematic review.
The main goal of the review is to collect the ultimate list of known issues/problems within symbolic 
execution field as well as exising approaches to solve those problems.

## Review process overview

The key activity of the review is to assess information within exising studies to acquire answers
to interesting questions. The list of studies is compiled from papers published within relevant engineering 
conferences that have been held starting from 1975. 

The assessment is accomplished within two rounds. _Round I_ (pre-assessment) is aimed at filtering out those
papers which have no relevant information as per review goals. Purpose of _Round II_ is to extract relevant
information.

Collected assessment results are further analyzed to answer primary questions of the review.
