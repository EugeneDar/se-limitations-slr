Symbolic Execution.
  
5. (Yes/No): Yes

If you answered 'Yes' please provide references to the location(s) within the study supporting your answer:  
(add as many list items 5.x as required in format `page No., citation`. Remove unnessesary items)

5.1 p.1, A key challenge in
dynamic symbolic execution is how to effectively explore the program’s execution paths to achieve high code coverage in a limited time
budget.  
5.2 p.1, ...inherent limitations of purely symbolic evaluation of programs
(e.g., handling non-linear arithmetic, external code)  

## Has the study introduced any new technique within Symbolic Execution field?

Please examine Abstract, Introduction and Contribution sections on the subject of mentioning any technique/approach/method related to Symbolic Execution.
  
6. (Yes/No): Yes

If you answered 'Yes' please provide below references to the location(s) within the study supporting your answer:  
(add as many list items 6.x as required in format `page No., citation`. Remove unnessesary items)

6.1 p.1, Dynamic symbolic execution is a modern variant of classical symbolic execution, which 
combines symbolic and concrete execution to mitigate the inherent limitations  
6.2 p.1, There are two major flavors of dynamic symbolic execution, namely concolic testing [1], [2] and 
execution-generated testing [3], [4].  
6.3 p.1, Search heuristics are a key component of both approaches to dynamic symbolic execution...
