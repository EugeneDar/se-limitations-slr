Symbolic Execution.
  
5. (Yes/No): `No`

If you answered 'Yes' please provide references to the location(s) within the study supporting your answer:  
(add as many list items 5.x as required in format `page No., citation`. Remove unnessesary items)

## Has the study introduced any new technique within Symbolic Execution field?

Please examine Abstract, Introduction and Contribution sections on the subject of mentioning any technique/approach/method related to Symbolic Execution.
  
6. (Yes/No): `Yes`

If you answered 'Yes' please provide below references to the location(s) within the study supporting your answer:  
(add as many list items 6.x as required in format `page No., citation`. Remove unnessesary items)

6.1 `p.1 To address this issue, we propose CSEFuzz, a fuzz testing approach based on symbolic execution for
defect detection. `  
6.2 `p.1-2 Symbolic execution partly solves the lack of test cases
in traditional test methods, and it has a good capability to find defects [7]–[9`  
6.3 `p.1 To solve this problem, this article proposes Coverageguided Symbolic Execution for Fuzz testing (CSEFuzz),
which is a defect detection approach based on combing symbolic execution and fuzz testing.`
6.4 `p.2 We proposed a defect detection approach by fuzz testing
based on symbolic execution. The symbolic execution
generates test cases with high coverage...`
6.5 `p.10 In view of this issue, this article used symbolic
execution to generate candidate test cases and then selected
initial seed test cases for fuzz testing from the candidate test
cases according to specific coverage criteria to improve the
efficiency of fuzz testing.`

## Has the study suggested any formal or informal proof of the limitations mentioned?

Please examine Abstract, Introduction and Contribution sections on the subject of mentioning any description or references to
formal or empirical proof justifying any of Symbolic Execution problems.
  
7. (Yes/No): `No`

If you answered 'Yes' please provide below references to the location(s) within the study supporting your answer:  
(add as many list items 7.x as required in format `page No., citation`. Remove unnessesary items)
